          <h2> Updates to Predictions for the 21st Century by Dennis Marx </h2>
          <p class="pt-2 pb-2 fw-bold">In 2014, Predictions for the 21st Century by Dennis Marx discussed the Global Population
             Collapse. Since then, there has been a growing recognition that this collapse is real and has serious 
             consequences. Some nations have instituted programs, almost all of them focusing on providing financial 
             support for families, to encourage increased fertility. These programs have not been successful. <br><br>

             Typically, social sciences look for causes through correlations. Low fertility is highly correlated to 
             urbanization, and female education. The stated desire for children among women has also been shown to have 
             a strong correlation to a nations fertility. These cases are meaningful, but not very helpful for taking 
             action to increase fertility. <br><br>
            
            Predictions instead considered evolutionary psychology and proposed that over millennia, evolution had honed 
            behaviors in humans that maximized genetic fitness and specifically fertility. Predictions then proposed that 
            radical changes in the human environment were driving the fertility collapse. This addendum presents a 
            framework to help analyze the issue. It hypothesizes how mankind’s evolution has been molded to maximize long 
            term, individual fitness. Finally, it speculates on ways to tailor our current environment to better fit human 
            nature. <br><br>
            </p>
    
            <h2>A Path to Arresting the Human Population Collapse</h2>

            <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">
              Homo Sapiens are Genetically Unfit to Live in their Natural Habitat.  <br><br>
            </p>
            <h4>Where We Are</h4>
            <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">
              The fact that humans built their habitat, or stumbled into it, doesn’t make it any less natural than a 
              beehive is less natural because bees built it. The fact that there are about 8 billion people on the 
              planet, doesn’t make them genetically fit if their fertility has fallen below replacement.  <br><br>
              Over the last 100 years, changes have occurred in mankind’s environment that have disrupted the human 
              reproductive cycle. It is in this new environment that Homo Sapiens are genetically unfit. In this 
              environment, human fertility is collapsing all over the world. If it were any other species, 
              environmentalists would be freaking out over the coming extinction due to mankind’s destruction of their 
              habitat. <br><br>

              There are many counties now trying to improve fertility rates. A quick internet search of  “Countries 
              trying to increase fertility” reveals that efforts are being made from the far east of Asia to the Far west of 
              Europe and from down south in Australia to the great white north in Canada. Paying is the right word. All 
              the programs reviewed provide financial incentives, and all the programs show no or unimpressive gains. 
              Hungary may be an exception to that, though there are signs that the exception was temporary. <br><br>
            </p>
            <h4>An Analysis Framework – A Black Box </h4>
            <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">An analysis of Evolutionary Psychology may provide a better road forward. A 
              program to improve male value and status might make a material difference. Attempting to reduce young 
              people’s exposure to global toxic culture might help. Finally, restoring male rights in families, and 
              parental rights over children and strengthening local civic institutions is another avenue to explore.
               <br><br>

              Research needs to be done on this topic. One source that has put some effort into these questions is 
              Birthgap.org. A major finding of their analysis is an estimate that 40% of women in countries with below 
              replacement fertility will go childless and that a very high majority of these women aspire to have 
              families. They also show that the average age when a woman has their first child increased from 24 to 30. 
              Hopefully they get support and   continue their effort and are joined by others in this work. <br><br>
              </p>
              <h5>The Black Box</h5>
              <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">Predictions was greatly influenced by The Moral Animal: Why We Are the Way We 
                Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology by Robert Wright. It was a very sobering and depressing 
                view of human nature. This view, however, informed Predictions understanding of the current fertility 
                collapse. Humans’ outlooks,  emotions and critical thinking are shaped by evolutionary history. Their 
                behavior has been  structured to maximize genetic fitness in their contemporaneous environment. Humans 
                have been at the apex for thousands of years, competition against other species has become immaterial. 
                Humans for at least the last 10,000 years if not longer, have been competing for survival almost solely 
                against humans. <br><br>

                The reality is complex. The human have been modifying their environment at an ever-increasing pace and 
                evolution is a mechanism that lags on many timeframes. Some of the time frames are only centuries, others 
                are millions of years. Rapid environmental change creates strong selection pressures and the changes in 
                the human environment continue to accelerate. A fertility collapse is as great instrument of selection 
                for creatures not in danger of predation as can be imagined.<br><br>
                
                A positive move toward impacting fertility, would be developing an understanding, in an Evolutionary 
                Psychiatric framework, of those aspects of human motivation governing it. Where do babies come from? What 
                governs and what limits mating selection and pair bonding in humans? How can we find out and how adjust 
                the world to improve the results?<br><br>
                
                The metaphor for the complex mix of emotions and drives that go into the human process of mating and pair 
                bonding is a Black Box, or The Fertility Black Box. Each human will have a different one, but there will 
                be great similarities. The inputs are the external environment, the culture and each persons’  history 
                and the output will be babies. This Black Box has been honed over millennia by evolution to maximize the 
                genetic fitness of each individual and this Black Box is what is dysfunctional in the current human 
                environment.<br><br>
                </p>
                <h5>The Hypothesis</h5>
                <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">Twin pillars that drive and control human fertility are sexual desire and 
                  an urge to gain and maintain social status. There are a wide array of other inputs, but these are the 
                  primary drivers.</p>
                  <h6>Sex Drives</h6>
                  <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">The sex drive aspect seems self-evident. It is worth mentioning the 
                    gender difference, however. Given the low male contribution to child creation and development, the 
                    male Fertility Black Box should, in general, have a low barrier for mating. There will be a much 
                    higher one for pair bonding. The female contribution in childbearing is high. Female gametes  are 
                    far fewer than for the male and the required time and commitment is orders of magnitude greater. 
                    The female Fertility Black Box should have a higher hurdle for mating.</p>
                    <h6>Status</h6>
                    <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">The people at the top of the hierarchy get the best of everything 
                      especially mating access. There is strong evidence of a bottleneck in male genetic survivorship 
                      occurring due to social changes in ranges between 10,000 and as recently a few centuries years ago. 
                      The changes were from hunter gatherers to agrarian and pastoral organization:<br><br>
                      A recent bottleneck of Y chromosome diversity coincides with a global change in culture in Genome 
                      Research - Genome Res. 2015. 25: 459-466 https://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/4/459<br><br>

                      And<br><br>

                      Patrilineal segmentary systems provide a peaceful explanation for the post-Neolithic Y-chromosome 
                      bottleneck in nature communications - Nature Communications volume 15, Article number: 3243 (2024)
                      https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47618-5<br><br>
                    

                      Over several millennia, males that were not at the top of the hierarchy had a vanishingly small 
                      chance of their offspring surviving past a few generations. In the ancient world, men that did 
                      not strongly and successfully compete to climb social structure disappeared. If you were in the 
                      bottom half, it was common evolutionary sense to take high risks with low chances of success  to 
                      improve your position. <br><br>

                      At the same time, women that attached themselves to high-status men greatly increased the chances 
                      of their male children thriving. Hypergamy is the nature of women, it is an evolutionary response 
                      to the environment in which they lived.<br><br>  </p>

                      <h6>Other Impacts</h6>
                      <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">These are hypotheses. They have strong evidence that led to them, 
                        but further study will lead to a greater understanding and likely to many surprises. It is also 
                        important to realize that the attributes being applied to men and women are on average. It is 
                        important to remember that everyone is atypical in some aspect. <br><br></p>
                        
                        <h3>Increasing Fertility</h3>
                        <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">While there are many avenues to improve fertility, three are 
                          considered below that could have high impacts. Childlessness in women is growing 
                          (See Birthgap.org). In 2014 only 3% of women over 50 in India were childless. In Italy this 
                          was 40% (see Predictions). Italy is where humanity is headed. This is caused by a broadening 
                          hypergamy and a reduced status and quality of men. One path is to improve the marriageability 
                          of men. This is discussed below. Also, the impact of hypergamy can be managed by supporting 
                          local civic life and by replacing distant images on screens with living human beings. Another 
                          way of limiting some of the negative aspects of hypergamy is to help young women come to an 
                          understanding of the personal costs of liaisons with high status men.<br><br>

                        <h4>A Modern Love Story</h4>
                        <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">A young woman, attractive, intelligent but a little unsure of 
                          herself, heads off to college. She has gotten into a good school, enough so that her family 
                          has some bragging rights about her. She finds her footing after a bit and makes some good 
                          friends. Some she sticks with over the years, but most just fade away. She had a boyfriend in 
                          high school, but that’s over. She has a couple in college that seemed important, but they end 
                          up disappointing her in one way or another.<br><br>

                          She wasn’t sure what she wanted to do, she was thinking about being a doctor and started down 
                          that path, but the competition was fierce, and she wanted a more balanced life with nights 
                          out and some travel every year. She was OK at math, but a lot of the people in those classes 
                          are very good at math and really into it and she just wasn’t and isn’t. She is a very good 
                          writer. She flirts with journalism, psychology, sociology, and literature. She might as well 
                          have chosen any of these in the end, it doesn’t really matter. Let’s say she ended up 
                          learning French and majoring in French literature. She did well in those classes and loved it 
                          and it fit with her sense of the adventure of her life.<br><br>
                          
                          She broke up with her boyfriend right after college. He suddenly went from sure of himself to 
                          having a hard time getting a job and being immature and trying to sleep with one of her 
                          friends. She had really liked him, but she wasn’t going to continue with that. She was young, 
                          attractive, and interesting so she got a lot of attention. Though every year it got a little 
                          less. There were a couple of men that she was taken with, but those never seemed to last. 
                          After a couple of years, she and a congressman’s son moved in together and that worked well 
                          for three years, but then he moved on.<br><br>
                          
                          Her career was OK. She did good work, but the dream jobs were for people that had endless 
                          ambition, and worked hard, or others that had connections or just really good luck. She had 
                          thought of trying to go to law school, a friend did, but she just couldn’t  collect the drive 
                          needed to study for the LSAT. <br><br>
                          
                        Suddenly, she was looking at 30. Her job was OK, but there wasn’t much room to go anywhere 
                        with it. Some of the men that had been interested before were still around, but they had all 
                        moved on. She would only admit it to herself in her darker moments, but she wanted a husband 
                        and a family. There was just a hint of desperation in the air.  A couple of her friends                           settled and got married. She was still attractive, she was smart, interesting, and 
                        well-traveled, but the men showing interest were not suitable. She fooled herself for a few 
                        months with one man, but that ended up in humiliation and she was suddenly looking at 35.<br><br>
                        
                        She did marry a man before she turned 40, but he didn’t want more children. He was almost 20 
                        years her senior with a couple of failed marriages and a few failed children. This was not 
                        how she saw her life turning out.<br><br>
                        
                        The moral of the story is that: There just aren’t enough high-value men to go around.<br><br>
                        </p>
                        <h4>Making Men Better</h4>
                        <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">Males are failing in today’s Western culture and today’s Western 
                        culture is failing them. This can be seen in the working age men dropping out of the 
                        workforce and the males forgoing college. Though on average, those men that get through 
                        college are taking the thoughtful, harder roads that get them to degrees that give them a 
                        future. <br><br>

                        Males in the United States and likely in many parts of the industrialized world are 
                        struggling. Working aged men are abandoning work in unprecedented numbers. Males are 
                        eschewing college, resulting in there being roughly 3 female graduates for every 2 males. 
                        Primary and secondary schooling has drifted into being college preparatory almost 
                        exclusively. They leave only the narrowest of paths to many lucrative and very necessary 
                        working-class professions. Schoolwork is being tailored more and more to topics and methods 
                        foreign to the average male sensibilities. <br><br>
                      </p>
                      <h5>Dropping Out</h5>
                      <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">
                        There are over 7 million males in the United States between the ages 25 to 54 who have 
                      left the workforce. They are neither working nor looking for work. Nicholas Eberstadt has 
                      been raising alarms about this for almost a decade. 
                      (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tJE3FnGpzg  or his book Men Without Work). 
                      He points out that this is a relatively new and growing problem. For the most part, the 
                      question is why. This why is the flip side of: Why not?<br><br>
                      </p>
                      <h5>Colleges</h5>
                      <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">There are now 33% more females entering college than males. 
                      This has been a consistent problem for over 30 years. Males dropping out of colleges at a 
                      higher rate. At graduation, there are 50% more females than males.

                    picture is more subtle. Areas of study with a mathematics backbone provide higher 
                    salaries and higher, in field, employment. This is true across broad categories. For 
                    instance, Business degrees in general don’t lead to strong employment or higher 
                    compensation, but business degrees in accounting or data systems do. Most STEM degrees in 
                    Biology, not tied to a medical career, do not garner the higher compensation or solid job 
                    prospects as most other STEM majors typically do. Unsurprisingly, the majors with a 
                    mathematical backbone are still dominated by males, even given the strong tide against 
                    males in schools overall. <br><br>
                              
                    There are four segments in college majors:<br><br>
                              
                    <em>Majors with Math Backbone: </em>These have high initial salaries, better job 
                    prospects and are heavily chosen by the minority of males in colleges. These almost 
                    always have more males that females, often by lopsided numbers.<br><br>
                              
                    <em>Teaching Tracks: </em>These have lower initial salaries, very good job prospects and 
                    are overwhelmingly chosen by females.<br><br>
                        
                    <em>Medical Tracks:</em> These have high initial salaries, very good job prospects and 
                    are overwhelmingly chosen by females.<br><br>
                        
                    <em>Other Tracks with limited or no Math Requirement </em>
                    (Primarily Humanities and Social Science but including most Business and Biology majors): 
                    These have low initial salaries, poorer job prospects and are heavily chosen by females, 
                    though not to extent the Teaching and Medical tracks are.<br><br>
                              
                    The average male completing college has a clearer path and better future prospect than 
                    the average female, but there are a lot fewer of them. It is also likely that the average 
                    male has been more insulated from the more toxic ideologies infecting the campus, since 
                    the majors they have pursued haven’t been as easy to corrupt.<br><br>
                              </p>

                    <h5>Primary and Secondary Schools</h5>
                    <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">More and more, secondary education has moved to become 
                    exclusively college prep. Paths to other, often even more lucrative options are available,
                    but de-emphasized and often never brought up. For every college major it is made clear 
                    what is required to get to the college, complete the major and the typical job prospects 
                    and starting salaries. There is also a constant drumbeat, even as the cost of college has 
                    ballooned until almost all graduates are deep in debt upon graduation, about how much 
                    greater lifetime earnings is for college graduates. <br><br>

                    These comparisons are not useful measures of the value of a college degree. Levels of 
                    intelligence are also highly correlated to lifetime earnings. To properly perform a study, 
                    it would be necessary to select 2 cohorts of equal intelligence attending college and, 
                    subtracting the cost of the education along with the delayed early earnings for a more 
                    accurate comparison. And this is just one adjustment required to make the comparison 
                    valid. It is very likely that if a study was done comparing people that chose to become an 
                    electrician with those choosing to enter college, that college would appear a poor choice.
                                <br><br>
                                
                    Primary and secondary schools have also always been geared more toward girls than boys. 
                    Boys just don’t sit still. However, recently, areas where boys have traditional excelled 
                    have been modified in ways to retard their success. An example is in math classes. An 
                    online calculus class provided during the COVID fiasco deviated from how calculus was 
                    traditionally presented. Steps were inserted, that required no thinking, were tedious, and 
                    added nothing insightful. These lowered the value of the course for everyone but were 
                    apparently designed to equalize the outcomes between boys and girls.<br><br>
                                </p>
                    <h4>So, what can we do?</h4>
                    <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">
                  The short answer is to help men become more successful and more useful. Education has 
                  been emphasized above because there are concrete numbers to show the current failings 
                  of universities for males. There are some facile options that the data suggest: <br><br>

                  Increase emphasis and funding on college majors males currently dominate, mainly STEM 
                  majors, but others as well if they are attractive to males were math is important. 
                  This at least broadens the paths males lean toward taking to be successful.<br><br>

                  Publicize alternate paths to success from being electricians, plumbers, mechanics for 
                  planes, trucks, equipment and cars, and long lists of other opportunities where short 
                  term training is available. Allowing proficiency testing to leave high schools early 
                  to start might be made available to those feeling stifled in today’s college prep 
                  programs.
                                        <br><br>
                  Move to some older, less corrupted, curriculums. Especially in science and math. 
                  Florida has famously been working to adopt a modified version of the Hillsdale 
                  curriculum. This would be a positive step, though it is a college prep program. 
                  Also, while there is value in Latin, there is more current practical value in Spanish.
                  Technical opportunities with and in Latin America are extensive.<br><br>
                                </p>
              <h4>Beyond Education</h4>
              <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">One thing that should be implemented that would help the 12% 
              of working age men currently out of the workforce would be to limit their benefits. While 
              direct welfare payments are limited, other indirect subsidies are widespread. Typically, 
              they will have free access to full medical coverage, food stamps, often utilities such as 
              electricity, phones and water are heavily subsidized if not free, housing might be as well, 
              and disability definitions are very lenient. If these were discontinued many males would 
              need to step up that are avoiding work currently. <br><br></p>
              <h4>Other Items</h4>
              <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">There are opportunities to improve the status of men in 
              other ways. Family law could likely be modified to improve the status of men, and the 
              culture is also ripe for improvement. There are many avenues, not covered above, that 
              could be tried. There should be an effort to find these. It is a strange and dramatic 
              thing to say, but the survival of peoples, nations, civilizations and humanity may 
              depend upon it.<br><br></p>

              <h4>A Tale of Liberation</h4>
            <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">
            A young girl grows up poor in rural Ethiopia. She has an older sister that married at 14 and moved to a 
            local town. The girl often visits the sister with her parents. The sister’s husband is well to do by their 
            standards. Her sister has a smart phone, and the young girl sits for hours exposing herself to the wide 
            world on her sister’s phone when she is in town.<br><br>

            As the young girl grows up, many of the local men and boys express an interest in marriage. Her parents 
            reject most as unacceptable, and she rejects the rest. As the young girl moves through her teens, her 
            parents become concerned about her prospects and pressure her to accept some of the now more limited 
            options available to her. She has wider dreams and is unmoved. 
              <br><br>
            Finally, her brother-in-law informs them that his older brother, now in is late forties, is looking for a 
            new wife. The brother lives in Germany and is a very good prospect by even the town’s historical standards. 
            The parents agree to the match. The brother sends money to the family and money for a trip to Mannheim for 
            the young girl. 
              <br><br>
            The girl leaves the airport at a stopover in Munich. She has researched where to go to get temporary 
            sanctuary and what to say to receive asylum. It takes forever for the whole process to go through, 
            and she stays on assistance while she waits. Her family looks for her, but she has used a false name,
            a false ethnicity and spends all her time learning German to make sure no translators are needed. 
            This is a very smart and determined young girl.
              <br><br>
            She begins to prosper. She gets educated. It takes time. She gets offers, but she is wise enough about 
            Germany to know that these offers are not what she wants. They are not what they at first seem. She has 
            some bad experiences and some good. She goes back to school a few times, as she has an active mind and a 
            deep curiosity. Twenty years after arriving in Germany, she marries a professor. He tries to have children 
            for her, but nothing ever comes of it. 
              <br><br>
            The moral of the story is that: The farther afield you look, the greener pastures appear.
              <br><br>
            </p>
            <h4>The Global Toxic Culture</h4>
            <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">
            There are cultures better than others, but none without advantages and none without faults. The global mass 
            culture’s sexual exploitation and glorifying of fetishes both lures and disgusts people in every 
            significant area on the planet. Especially with its recent insistence of exposing the seamiest aspects of 
            this to children.<br><br>

            At the same time, those that are stifled and oppressed by the local culture often yearn for an escape. 
            These feelings can come from causes that go from trivial to existential. 
            <br><br>
            In the end, both sides can impede family creation. The young seeing the glamourous world of the outside 
            can reset expectations to the unobtainable highs seeming to exist in distant cultures. Similarly, 
            the realities of those distant cultures usually fail to match the dreams the images that the now ubiquitous 
            screens beget. 
            <br><br>
            </p>
            <h5>Solzhenitsyn </h5>
          <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">
          Consider the case of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a famous Russian author expelled in the 1970’s by the Soviets 
          after receiving the Nobel Prize for literature and gaining too much celebrity to dispose of.  
          In the Gulag Archipelago  he exposed the vast socialist slave labor camps, from firsthand accounts and 
          personal experience. <br><br>

          He came from a country where socialism, a murderous, soul crushing ideology had been overlaid upon a 
          spiritual, fatalistic,  rural culture with a history of oppression. He came to the West, with visions of a 
          free and dazzling society, but was met with a society where intellectually shallow and hedonistic elites had 
          abandoned all spirituality. Where the ruling classes had forgotten or even maligned the lessons and wisdom of 
          their forefathers. He warned them that they were stumbling along a path destined to look like the hell he had 
          survived if there wasn’t a renaissance. He became very unpopular.<br><br>  
          </p> 
          <h5>Amish & Mennonites</h5> 
        <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">
        The Amish (and Mennonites) are doubling in population every 20 years. They have mostly walled themselves off 
        from the global culture that surrounds them and provide their members with a meaningful and fulfilling life. <br><br>
        The Amish have a tradition, Rumspringa, where children late in their teens are allowed to enter the wider world 
        before they commit themselves to the church. Many chose not to go and very few, maybe 10%, end up leaving the 
        church. Marriage stays within the church and families are supported and sustained by the congregation. A girl 
        might view a good match as a hard-working son of a successful family, or the son of a respected church elder. 
        The marital ambitions are not for a rich financier, or some famous athlete, but someone real, someone they know.
        <br><br>
        </p>
        <h5>Should We All Become Mennonites?</h5>
      <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">
        Any statements about what drives the higher fertility for the Amish in the current environment will at best be 
        speculative. The top prospect leading to strong fertility is the high rate of family formation and stability. 
        Other aspects are the younger ages of marriage and the low usage of modern birth control.<br><br>

        The BirthGap.org estimated the 40% of women in modern, developed nations will go childless and that a majority 
        of those want to form families. If there are acceptable males readily available, then these families will be 
        created. Because the Amish have walled off the broader world, Amish girls do not develop unrealistic 
        expectations. The Amish also emphasize hard work and clear paths to success, so enough Amish males meet the 
        females expectations.
        <br><br>
        Civic institutions could support social activities where people can socialize and include outreach to men and 
        boys to provide developmental support. Churches are natural centers for such things. Public schools have 
        become institutionalized, promoting distant agendas. However, new schools more responsive to local parents can 
        be developed. Multiple states now provide support for independent schools and in many nations and cultures 
        local, parent supported schools are more traditional. 
        <br><br>
        One other idea is to incorporate these ideas into neighborhoods. The Greeks had a tradition of an Agora. A 
        local market with spaces for learning and where those and other civic and government activities could flourish. 
        These are often very attractive spaces and could provide strong financial rewards for those that build them and 
        those that live there.
        <br><br>
        Related to firming up local community and to the delays in family formation is the practice of sending girls 
        off to college in distant cities. First, this can alienate girls from their existing community, essentially 
        breaking down the barriers with the broad, toxic culture. Second, it can delay pair bonding, sometimes even 
        beyond college since there are so few males living up to the woman’s new, perceived stature. 
        <br><br>
        Sending a young, naive girl off to a distant college should not be automatic. If the girl doesn’t have a clear 
        goal, she is likely to end up with high debt and a degree of little or no value in the humanities or social 
        sciences. Given the statistics on salaries and majors, this is more likely to negatively impact girls than boys. 
        An evaluation of aptitude, attitude and desires should govern the decision. Family first and career later should 
        no longer be considered a poor second choice.
        <br><br>
      </p>
      <h4>The Winner</h4>
      <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">
        A tall athletic, quick, hardworking  young man enjoyed basketball. He was the star player in his high school. 
        Colleges heavily recruited him, and he became a star in a good university as well. He was drafted into the NBA 
        and became a solid player for an average team. <br><br>

        One thing he found along the way, was that he had it easy with girls. He sort of had a girlfriend in high school, 
        but that quickly faded in college. College was a little wild for him, especially after his sophomore year when 
        everyone began anticipating he would make it to the NBA. 
        <br><br>
        He got some solid coaching in college about basketball and then about life, birth control, and the financial and 
        legal hazards of unwanted pregnancies for basketball stars. He was a very smart kid, and he took these lessons to 
        heart. He had many liaisons, but no unwanted children.
        <br><br>
        The moral of the story is that: A winning strategy might not work if they change the rules.
        <br><br>
        A more judicious use of contraceptives could also increase fertility. In times past, sex was more consequential 
        and hence was entered into by both men and women with greater forethought. This is true for women especially as 
        they face more serious outcomes. Restricting access to extra-marital sex could lead to earlier marriage 
        formation and increased fertility. <br><br>

        There are numerous accurate arguments for easy access to birth control: It gives women more control of their 
        bodies. It reduces unwanted pregnancies and teen-age motherhood. One argument is based on a fallacy, however. 
        Adults and children can refrain from sex. It is not even that hard for most. It should be emphasized that the 
        Pill is a powerful mind-altering drug that has severe side-effects and should not be taken lightly. 
        (see https://ideas.ted.com/how-the-birth-control-pill-affects-your-mood/ and 
        https://www.amenclinics.com/blog/the-pills-surprising-and-scary-effects-on-the-brain/ ).
        <br><br>
        There is one change that should be made. Currently, doctors must prescribe the Pill to minors and are not 
        allowed to inform parents in many jurisdictions. Doctors have even recommended it to younger teenagers, 
        promoting it as a drug that reduces acne. Many girls (and boys) would take a drug to reduce acne without 
        concern for the consequences. This should be changed. Taking any serious drug should require parental 
        consultation and consent.
        <br><br>
      </p>
      <h3>Global Fertility Index</h3>
      <h5>Reviewing Fertility</h5>
      <p class="pt-2 mb-9 fw-bold">
        Predictions developed a Global Fertility Index (GFI) by considering a population weighted average of the Total 
        Fertility Rate (TFR) of 18 countries that represented a complete range of regions and 2/3rds of the world 
        population as of 2014. The Global Fertility Index used data from the United States Census Bureau* (Link below):
        <br><br>
        https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/#/dashboard?menu=countryViz&dashboard_page=country&COUNTRY_YR_ANIM=2025        
        <br><br>
        In 2014, the GFI was 2.30, or slightly above replacement. The GFI in January 2025 is 1.95.  On average each 
        woman will give birth to 0.35 less children than women were producing 10 years before. 17 of the 18 countries 
        in the showed a drop in fertility. The outlier was Germany that had a small increase from a TFR of 1.47 to 1.59,
         still well below replacement.  <br><br>

        The US Census still has quite muted projections of future fertility reductions. They see the GFI falling 0.17 
        less children per mother to 1.78 over the next 25 years after falling .35 over the last 10. A GFI of under 
        1.5 by 2050 is more likely. <br><br>

        An interesting tidbit. In the 18 countries making up the GFI, the population increased by a little under 10%. 
        However, the number of women under 30 dropped by over 2%.  The percentage of women under 30 as a percentage of 
        the population dropped by over 10%. This is where babies come from. A reduced population is already built in 
        the 2025 population pyramid. If the current global fertility remains unchanged, the reduction will be 
        exponential. If the fertility continues to drop as expected the population drop will be beyond exponential.
